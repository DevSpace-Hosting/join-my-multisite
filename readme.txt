Automatically add existing users to any site on your network that they visit, or let them decide at the click a button.

== Description ==

When you want to add a user to every site on your network, you've got some pretty cool plugins for that as a network admin. But sometimes you want to let your site-managers have that control, and sometimes you want to make it optional.

By activating this plugin, you give your Site Admins the following options:

* Auto-add users
* Have a 'Join This Site' button in a widget

It's really that simple! 

If they decide to auto-add, then any time a logged in user visits a site, they will be magically added to that site.

If they decide to use a 'Join This Site' button, then they can customize the button message text for users who are logged in but not members, not logged in, or already members. Don't worry, if you have registation turned off, they won't see the 'register' button.
